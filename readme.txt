Q: What's this extention for?
A: This extension is used in google-chrome browser, and it is only useful when you do search with Google or Baidu search engine, it helps you to navigate between search results without mouse.

Q: What can I benefit from it?
A: Sometimes we don't to use 'tab' key or mouse to navigate between results, this extension can release yourself just typing 'j' or 'k' to select one result and 'enter' to open it. And it also provides 'i' to refocus for the first text input(mostly the first input is just the search input). These are much quicker than you use mouse.
